# Hi, I'm Darren 👋 

I'm a **Senior Frontend Engineer** based in Dundee, UK. I specialise in building high-performance, scalable web applications, primarily using React and TypeScript.

### 🚀 What I'm working on
After an incredible year off for travel across the world (🇯🇵🇰🇷🇨🇳🇭🇰🇻🇳🇲🇾🇸🇬🇮🇸🇨🇿🇦🇹🇭🇺🇺🇸) I'm currently deep-diving into refreshing my skillset by learning React 19, Tailwind, Vite, Playwright and AI-assisted development.

I am currently open to new Senior Frontend opportunities in the UK. If you're building high-performance web apps with React, let's chat.

### 🌐 Open Source Contributions
I'm a strong believer in the open-source ecosystem. My most significant contributions have been to **[Rikaikun](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adarren-lester+)**, a popular Japanese translation extension for Chrome with 200,000 users.
